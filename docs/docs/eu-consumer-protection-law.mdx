# EU Consumer Protection Law

This document introduces briefly EU legislation concerning consumer protection, with particular emphasis on unfair contract terms, which is the subject of this work.

## Overview

**European consumer law** concerns consumer protection within Europe, particularly through [European Union law][9] and the [European Convention on Human Rights][8] [\[1\]](#1).

The [Treaty on the Functioning of the European][2] Union [article 169][3] says that _"in order to promote the interests of consumers and to ensure a high level of consumer protection, the Union shall contribute to protecting the health, safety and economic interests of consumers, as well as to promoting their right to information, education and to organise themselves in order to safeguard their interests"_ [\[2\]](#2).

These are the main EU Directives on the matter:
* Product Liability Directive ([85/374/EEC][4])
* Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive ([93/13/EEC][5])
* Unfair Commercial Practices Directive ([2005/29/EC][6])
* Consumer Rights Directive ([2011/83/EU][7])

The EU customer protection system is based on the idea that _"the consumer is in a weak position vis-à-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge"_ [\[3\]](#3).

Consumer protection in EU a vivid subject under continous change. This is said on [Review of Consumer Law][11] website: _"In its 2020 consumer policy strategy, the “New Consumer Agenda”, the [European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en) announced that it would analyse whether additional legislation or other action was needed in the medium-term to ensure equal fairness online and offline. For that reason, the Commission launched in spring 2022 a [Fitness Check of EU consumer law on digital fairness][12]"_ [\[4\]](#4).

## New Deal for Consumers

_"In 2017 the European Commission carried out a [thorough evaluation of existing consumer rules][17]. It showed that the current EU consumer legalisation works well, but stressed that the rules were not applied and enforced effectively across the EU. There is also a need to raise awareness among consumers and businesses about their rights and obligations. The review identified targeted revisions to eliminate unnecessary costs for traders and to modernise the rules in the light of today's global trends and new business practices"_ [\[5\]](#5).

_"The Commission's New Deal for Consumers is a proposal that will guarantee that all European consumers fully benefit from their rights. It will also strengthen the public and private enforcement of these rules, ensuring that authorities have the power to impose deterrent sanctions and consumers can access compensation if their rights are breached"_ [\[5\]](#5).

Under the New Deal for Consumers two new Directives were proposed: the [Omnibus Directive][15] (27 November 2019) and the [Directive on Representative Actions][16] (25 November 2020). These are the Directives that were updated:
* Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive ([93/13/EEC][5])
* Unfair Commercial Practices Directive ([2005/29/EC][6])
* Consumer Rights Directive ([2011/83/EU][7])
* Consumer protection in the indication of the prices of products offered to consumers ([98/6/EC][14])

### Omnibus Directive

Regarding unfair contract terms, this Directive ammends the [Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive][5]. The article 8b is introduced, which urges Member States to lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements and provides a non-exhaustive and indicative criteria that Member States must consider when imposing penalties [\[6\]](#6).

### Directive on Representative Actions

The Directive on Representative Actions is a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers and repealing Directive 2009/22/EC [\[16\]](#16).
